# stock-price-prediction

Stock price prediction using ARIMA and LSTM neural networks.

## Overview

This project aims to predict and forecast future prices for a given stock using ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) for traditional time series forecasting and LSTM (long short-term memory) neural networks for advanced machine learning modelling.
